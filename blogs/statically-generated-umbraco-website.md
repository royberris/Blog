# The Statically Generated Umbraco Website

Static site generation has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. When combined with Umbraco's powerful content management capabilities, it creates a perfect balance between editorial flexibility and website performance.

## Why Static Generation?

Static generation offers several key advantages:

- **Performance**: Pre-built HTML files serve incredibly fast
- **Security**: Reduced attack surface with no database queries on the frontend
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale with CDNs and edge networks
- **Cost-effective**: Lower hosting costs and resource requirements

## Implementation Strategies

There are several approaches to implementing static generation with Umbraco:

### 1. Build-time Generation
Generate all pages during the build process, perfect for content that doesn't change frequently.

### 2. Incremental Static Regeneration
Update specific pages when content changes, combining the benefits of static and dynamic content.

### 3. Hybrid Approach
Mix static and server-rendered pages based on content requirements and update frequency.

## Best Practices

When implementing static generation with Umbraco, consider these best practices:

- Implement proper cache invalidation strategies
- Use webhooks to trigger rebuilds when content changes
- Optimize images and assets for faster loading
- Implement proper SEO metadata handling

The combination of Umbraco's content management capabilities with static generation creates powerful, performant websites that scale beautifully.
