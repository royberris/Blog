# Umbraco Community Day 2023

On the 13th of december I attended Umbraco Community Day in person as a speaker and just hanging out behind the scenes.

It was an amazing experience to connect with the Umbraco community and share knowledge about the latest developments in the CMS world. The event brought together developers, content creators, and Umbraco enthusiasts from around the globe.

## Key Highlights

- Networking with fellow Umbraco developers
- Learning about new features and best practices
- Sharing experiences and solutions
- Building stronger community connections

The day was filled with insightful presentations, hands-on workshops, and plenty of opportunities to connect with like-minded professionals in the Umbraco ecosystem.
