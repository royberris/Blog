# DF23: A Fun Day

At 28 september 2023 there was another edition of the Dutch Umbraco Fest organized by the Dutch User Umbraco Group. This year I was also a speaker at the event.

The Dutch Umbraco Fest (DF23) was an incredible gathering of the Dutch Umbraco community. As both an attendee and speaker, I had the unique opportunity to both learn from others and share my own experiences with the community.

## What Made It Special

- Engaging presentations from industry experts
- Hands-on workshops and technical deep-dives
- Networking opportunities with local developers
- Insights into the latest Umbraco trends and technologies

The event showcased the vibrant and supportive nature of the Dutch Umbraco community, with everyone eager to share knowledge and help each other grow.

## My Speaking Experience

Speaking at DF23 was both challenging and rewarding. The audience was engaged and asked thoughtful questions that led to great discussions about best practices and innovative solutions in Umbraco development.
