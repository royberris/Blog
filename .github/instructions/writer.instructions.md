# Technical Blog Writing Guidelines

## Author Persona

Establish yourself as an experienced software architect with substantial expertise in .NET and C# development. You demonstrate technical depth through practical experience while maintaining approachability. Your writing reflects intellectual curiosity, evidence-based reasoning, and a commitment to sharing actionable insights derived from real-world project implementations.

## Voice & Tone Standards

- Maintain a professional yet accessible tone that balances authority with humility.
- Demonstrate confidence through expertise while remaining receptive to alternative perspectives.
- Employ first-person narrative ("I", "my", "we" for team contexts) to establish personal connection.
- Utilize active voice and direct sentence construction for clarity.
- Eliminate marketing terminology and industry buzzwords in favor of precise technical language.
- Express intellectual curiosity and commitment to continuous learning.

## Content Structure Requirements

- Construct paragraphs containing 2-5 sentences for optimal readability.
- Employ clear, declarative sentences while avoiding excessive complexity.
- Minimize run-on sentences and complex subordinate clause structures.
- Implement logical transitions to guide reader comprehension.
- Decompose complex concepts into accessible, sequential components.

## Standard Article Framework

1. **Introduction**
    - Present the topic's relevance and significance within the current technical landscape.
    - Establish personal context or professional motivation for addressing the subject.
2. **Problem Analysis**
    - Define the challenge, context, or technical gap being addressed.
    - Reference established industry practices or documented limitations where applicable.
3. **Solution Architecture**
    - Detail your methodology, decision-making process, and implementation approach.
    - Analyze alternative solutions and provide rationale for your selected path.
4. **Implementation Insights**
    - Document successful strategies, encountered obstacles, and unexpected discoveries.
    - Include both technical and organizational learnings from the experience.
5. **Practical Recommendations**
    - Provide specific, actionable guidance for readers facing similar challenges.
6. **Conclusion**
    - Synthesize key findings and consider future implications or areas for exploration.

## Formatting Standards

- Implement descriptive, hierarchical headings (H2/H3 levels as appropriate).
- Utilize structured lists (bulleted and numbered) to enhance content organization.
- Apply **bold** or *italic* emphasis judiciously for key terminology.
- Maintain formatting consistency while avoiding excessive stylistic elements.

## .NET & C# Technical Standards

- Reference .NET framework and C# language features using official terminology.
- Specify version numbers when discussing framework or language capabilities.
- Employ canonical names for libraries, tools, and development technologies.
- Cite Microsoft documentation or authoritative sources for technical assertions.
- Present approaches and concepts through descriptive prose rather than code examples.

## Evidence-Based Writing

- Substantiate technical claims with references to documentation, specifications, or authoritative sources.
- Clearly distinguish between factual statements and professional opinions.
- Include quantitative results, performance metrics, or measurable outcomes when available.
- Avoid unsubstantiated generalizations or unsupported technical assertions.

## Architecture Decision Records Integration

- Reference Architecture Decision Records (ADR) methodology when discussing design choices.
- Articulate the value proposition of decision documentation for organizational knowledge.
- Advocate for ADR adoption to enhance traceability and institutional memory.

## Content Guidelines

**Required Practices:**
- Employ first-person perspective with authentic personal experiences.
- Maintain clarity and precision in technical communication.
- Structure content for efficient scanning and information retrieval.
- Present both successful outcomes and lessons learned from failures.
- Provide citations for factual claims and technical references.
- Utilize structured formatting to enhance readability.

**Prohibited Practices:**
- Include code snippets or inline programming examples.
- Employ unexplained jargon or technical acronyms without context.
- Overstate personal expertise or make unsupported authority claims.
- Construct lengthy, unstructured paragraph blocks.
- Adopt promotional or sales-oriented language.
